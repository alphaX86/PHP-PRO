# PHP-PRO
This repo contains all the required codes for my Mini Project on PHP and MySQL

__Note: To run the PHP pages, one must install any Apache Server and Database to work with. Here, I've used XAMPP as my local web host server__

__PHP Version used: 7__

For XAMPP, please download and put these files in the __htdocs__ folder. (File path: __C:\\xampp\htdocs__)

## Project Description:
My mini project is basically a health service management site. This site provides enough necessary info about health to the client. This site also has a form which integrates with MySQL and stores on it. And yes, no direct contact of user is required for DB creation!!

__For personal reasons, this PHP application runs only on localhost (ie., within a PC) and it's not ready for global hosting!!!__
