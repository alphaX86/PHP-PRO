# PHP-PRO
This repo contains all the required codes for my Mini Project on PHP and MySQL

__Note: To run the PHP pages, one must install any Apache Server and Database to work with. Here, I've used XAMPP as my local web host server__

__PHP Version used: 7__

For XAMPP, please download and put these files in the __htdocs__ folder. (File path: __C:\\xampp\htdocs__)

## Project Description:
My mini project is basically a health service management site. This site provides enough necessary info about health to the client. This site also has a form which integrates with MySQL and stores on it. And yes, no direct contact of user is required for DB creation!!

The site also contains provision of ADMIN privilege to view the entries of Database.

__ADMIN Login:__

  __Username:*admin*__
  
  __Password:*1234*__


__For personal reasons, this PHP application runs only on localhost (ie., within a PC) and it's not ready for global hosting!!!__
